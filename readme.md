## GRBL CNC Controls

A collection of .NET controls written in C# that I use to build my GCode senders, including a camera control based on [AForge libraries](http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/downloads.html).

An application for configuring GRBL utilizing some of the controls is included as a separate project:

The data entry fields are dynamically created according to a config file and facilitates easy configuration of GRBL.

#### NOTE:

I do not plan (for the time beeing) to release any of my GCode senders based on the controls libray. Currently I have made one for my CO2 laser and one for my mini mill/router - and I plan to add one for my lathe to complement the [MPG/DRO pendant](https://github.com/terjeio/GRBL_MPG_DRO_BoosterPack).
